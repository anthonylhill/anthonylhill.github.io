<h1 style="text-align:center">PiZero Adapter for Lee Hart&#39;s Membership Card</h1>

<p>There is a lot to like about <a href="http://www.sunrise-ev.com/1802.htm">Lee Hart&#39;s Membership Cart</a> (MC). It comes in a compact attractive form factor supporting a 4 MHz 1802, up to 64K of RAM, serial I/O, and lots of switches and blinkenzee lights. &nbsp;Supplied in kit format, it&rsquo;s a fun build with an amazing amount of documentation, not to mention Lee Hart&rsquo;s personal support to help you get things running if you have trouble.</p>

&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Having said all that, after a few months of usage I felt like there was a little more needed if I was going to do any serious programming with the MC. &nbsp;Toggling in programs with the front panel switches starts out fun but gets old fast. &nbsp;Programming EEPROMs is a slow process and they cut into the 64K of available RAM. &nbsp;Adding serial program download capability to a monitor program is a viable option but requires either an EPROM or a fairly long manual program load via switches. &nbsp; The earlier MC models had a DB25 connector that could be hooked up to an old school printer port (or GPIO on a microcontroller) but that usually meant an ugly ribbon cable with limited distance cluttering up your workspace. &nbsp;And the release of the new MC front panel card meant the DB25 went away in favour of six 7 segment LED&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve designed and built a PCB Raspberry PiZero W loader card that&rsquo;s format compatible with the MC and &nbsp;inserts in the middle of the Membership card&rsquo;s two card stack. &nbsp;That maintains the look and feel of the MC while allowing just a thin 5V power cable as the only hookup to the MC. &nbsp;The built-in Pi Zero contains my complete 1802 development environment (editor &amp; A18 &amp; source files) interfaced with a few simple scripts to the 1802 itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And the best part is that it&#39;s all 100% accessible via WiFi from any PC or laptop running SSH. Alternatively you can attach a USB keyboard and HDMI (or composite video monitor) for local programming. And maybe even a GUI based environment if that interests you. (Of course the GUI option could be used remotely over X or via VNC).</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Create 1802 programs, edit, assemble, and load to MC&#39;s 1802 memory entirely over Wifi</li>
	<li>Programs loaded to 1802 memory via DMA and override of the MC front panel switches</li>
	<li>PiZero can start, halt, or reset 1802 in addition to loading code to memory.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Intercepts the 1802&#39;s interrupt signal from the front panel when PiZero is in control so that front panel interrupts from LED MUX circuit don&#39;t disrupt downloads.</li>
	<li>Serial console interface for terminal I/O between PiZero and 1802 via Q &amp; EF3 to PiZero&#39;s UART GPIO pins (with PiZero running minicom)</li>
	<li>Able to read parallel output from 1802 to MC Front Panel for debugging or for high speed data exchange between PiZero&amp;1802 in conjunction with switch overrides</li>
	<li>Prototype interconnect area with connections for three uncommitted PiZero GPIO pins and the 1802 ef1, ef2, &amp; interrupt pins (plus 5v , 3.3v, &amp; GND)</li>
	<li>Jumpers to short the MWR and RUN connections from front panel</li>
	<li>Power, USB, HDMI, and composite video available via accessible PiZero connectors on rear of stack</li>
	<li>Power both MC and PiZero via a single USB wall wart</li>
	<li>Maintains MC&#39;s all-in-one compact form factor (requires extension ring to fit into Altoids tin)</li>
	<li>Works with either version of MC front panel. Or without any front panel</li>
	<li>Safely manages 3.3v to 5v to 3.3v level conversions as needed</li>
	<li>Ground connection post for scope or logic probe.</li>
	<li>PiZero utility written in C to load program code to 1802</li>
